## Seeds

A fake leaderboard and completions are included as part of the setup process.

## Login

Locally, you can use "Mock Login" to sign in with a testing account. In production, the auth mechanism
are OAuth and JWT-based flows.

## Code

This app was built in a few days for a conference. So things are a bit hacked together and built with
a "v1 is fine" mentality.

Code organization is somewhat there, although several things were thrown together. The app itself is built
using LiveView, with the main page being a JS carousel (Splide JS).
